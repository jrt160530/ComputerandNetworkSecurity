This repository has some of the work done for a computer and network security course. We covered some fundamental concepts including: security overview, malware, software security, network security, cryptography, private key public key, key management, hashes and message digests, authentication, kerberos & x.509 authentication, access control, secured protocols, IPSec, SSL/TLS, SSH,  intrusion detection / prevention systems (IDS/IPS), VPN, firewalls, Wireless LAN security, botnets, and some common attacks such as those seen in the SEED labs. 
 
We worked some of the SEED labs. Link for SEED Labs - https://seedsecuritylabs.org/
The code and documentation in the repository are from the SEED labs worked. 
I worked the labs using Oracle virtual box.
